This is the official repository for the El Shaddai Private School website, developed by Peace Nkhwazi in 2024. The website is built using HTML5, CSS3 (via `vn.css`), and JavaScript (via `vn.js`), with Google Fonts (Poppins) for typography. Key features include a responsive navigation menu, an interactive application modal for downloading/uploading forms, and sections highlighting the school's mission, academic programs, and admission process. Future enhancements include form validation, mobile responsiveness, and animations.
